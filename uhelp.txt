u is a tool used to query Unicode characters.

Usage:
  u [options]
  u [-p | --noprecomb] <char> [diacritic ...]
  u [options] (<LaTeX> | <symbol> | <string>)

Arguments:
  char        Any single character to be combined with diacritics
  diacritic   A word representing a diacritic or a combining Unicode character.
              Use --showdiac for a list of words.
  LaTeX       A LaTeX control sequence, with or without leading '\'
  symbol      A word representing a symbol (e.g. 'deg' for a degree symbol)
  string      A string of diacritic symbols (using LaTeX naming) ending
              in a character to combine them with.

Options:
  -p, --noprecomb          precombined characters are not preferred
  -l, --nolatex            no checking for LaTeX commands
  -s, --nosymbol           no checking for symbols
  -c, --nocomb             no combining characters
  -r, --nortrim            only convert whole strings (e.g. '\betas' would not
                           become 'βs')
  --show                   displays all diacritic words and symbols and exits
  -h, --help, -?, /?       displays this help and exits
